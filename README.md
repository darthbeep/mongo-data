# mongo-data

## Instructions for perl.py and mongo.pl:
I'm sure you're probably wondering what these are for. perl.py is just a wrapper that calls mongo.pl. mongo.pl is where the fun happens. It's basically just the assignment but in perl. Which makes it awesome. To run, you'll need to install MongoDB and JSON for perl.

This can be done by installing cpan (choose the right one for your OS): http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html.

Then:

`cpan MongoDB`

`cpan JSON`
